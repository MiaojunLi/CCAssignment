1.As the first try, if we drop an egg from the 10th floor, then 20th floor..
The worst case is it’s 100th floor that will break an egg, then it will take 9 times to go to 90th floor and 9 times to go to 99th floor, so totally it will be 18 times.
2.If we start at 15, then 30… we will decrease the drop of egg1 but we will increase the drop of egg2 in case of the worst case.That means we should make a balance between egg1 and egg2.
3.The best solution is that we can go floor 14, then 27, then 39,… This will takes 14 steps in the worst case. 
Or we can go to floor 50 first , then increase 10 or decrease 10 each time based on 50 is smaller or bigger, and then increase 1 each time when we find the right range of 10.It is also 14 times in the worst case.
