The solution is as follows:
Take one pill from bottle1, two pills from bottle 2,three pills from bottle 3,and so on.
Then weight the sum of these pills, if all pills were one gram, the weight will be (1+2+3+â€¦+20=210). 
While the below equation will tell you the bottle number that has pills of weight 1.1 grams:

	(Weight-210grams)/(0.1grams) 

For example, if the weight is 211.1, then the bottle 13 has the heavy pills.
